# Makefile.Win.insani - Makefile rules for Windows + MSYS2
#
# This makefile assumes an MSYS2 + MINGW64 environment, installed
# to the default path (C:\msys64\).  See README for setup details.
# If your MSYS2 install path is different from the default, you will
# have to edit this makefile accordingly.
#
# Notice that unlike the macOS makefile, the Windows makefile does
# not generate sardec.exe or nsadec.exe.  This has to do with the
# fact that these two utilities make heavy usage of POSIX functionality
# that simply doesn't exist in Windows, or at least didn't until
# recently.  Unfortunately, executables that target such functionality
# in Windows end up having to ship a POSIX compatibility layer like
# msys2.dll or cygwin.dll, or have to be targetted at ucrt64 -- which
# does not gracefully support Windows 7 and below.  This is why we
# omit sardec and nsadec, and instead build using MINGW64 -- which is
# maximally compatible with every modern Windows version in existence.
